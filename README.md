## Overview of Election Audit
An election commission has requested additional data to complete an audit of the election. Including, the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county of the total total count, and the county with the highest turnout. We are to supply these items and write them to a text file. Finally, we are to provide a written analysis of what we have found and the results of our analysis.

## Application of Program
The program written can be applied to any other election with a few small changes of the script. Firstly, you can use the basic architecture with a different data set as long as you modify the csv file to match the name of the file, and columns as well as the filepath to the files. You can also apply the same script, with some small changes, to any other basic elections info. Whether that be reapplying it to a national election instead of a congressional election - any level of election really. Or if you are interested in the percentage of voter turnout, that could be achieved with a very small amount of time and change.
